# canterburytales
Mr first experiment with Java
This is my first ever programming project and is the result of my initial steps in self-teaching in Java.

It is a text-based game that is inspired by Geoffrey Chaucer's 14th century poem, The Canterbury Tales. The user joins a set of pilgrims about to set forth on their journey to Canterbury. They are asked some questions to determine what kind of tale they want to hear to help pass the time en route. After the first tale is told, each pilgrim takes it in turn to tell their tale. The program shows how far along the pilgrimage the group has travelled in between tales based on the the length of the tale and the reading speed of the pilgrim.
